# Welcome to PyTG's documentation 

PyTG is a Python3 framework for bootstraping and structuring Telegram bots projects. It focuses on improving the reusability and testability of the source code by isolating each feature in a separate module. It may be used to realize general-purpose applications as well, although there are no guarantess that the paradigms proposed adapt to any unforeseen usage.

This tool is not strictly bound to any APIs wrapper, but most of the standard modules are developed to work with [python-telegram-bot](https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot/).

**PyTG is in still under development and should not be used for safety-critical application**.
